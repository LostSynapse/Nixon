Nixon - Automatic Studio Recorder

In early stages of active development on my own timeline. Do not ask me for help or bugfixes at this time.

This is in development on a Radxa Rock5B with a class compliant Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 3rd gen and 256 NVME

The primary purpose of the device is to quietly stand by and automatically record when audio is detected.

I have it hooked up to a pair of monitor outputs and send it a full mix of everything in my studio.
As they say, you should always be recording in case you are struck with inspiration.

With this setup, it's set and forget. 

Take a look at manual_setup.md if you want to check it out.

currently not completing a build. attempted AI refactor to change audio backend to bypass a bug with an include and it failed miserably
